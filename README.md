# maia-bot
## A general-purpose Discord API bot in Python.

Welcome to Maia's tavern! Where sidetrack is the spice of life.

The bot is equipped with utilities that mostly annoy her patrons. Published for
educational purposes.

## Usage

Maia uses a pseudo-tasking system that activates certain command sets by using
Discord API's Cogs. Firstly, start up one or more cogs:

`maia play <cog_name>`

Cogs can also be automatically started on bot launch. This can be edited inside
`./data/config.json`.

After starting desired cogs, call her by name to evoke commands. For example:

`maia help` - Displays help.

`Maia, roll 3d6 2 fireballs` - Rolls two sets of 3 6-sided dice (6 total) for
the purpose of 'fireballs'.

Cogs can be deactivated as well.

`maia stop <cog_name>`
